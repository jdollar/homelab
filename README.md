# J-ðŸ’µ Homelab

## Overview


### Structure of Repository

This repository is split up into three parts for the various components of setting up my homelab:

- Infrastructure as Code
  - `infrastructure` directory
- Configuration as Code
  - `ansible` directory
- Orchestration as Code
  - `app-of-apps` and `charts` directories

Each individual section will contain it's own README.md with additional information if needed.
